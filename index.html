                seen
                in more than a century. More than four million people have been left stranded.</p>

                <p>Whereas a decade ago, floods would cause starvation, and we would be called upon to immediately
                    provide food relief, now our communities have gained the wherewithal to ensure they have dry food
                    stocks at home. But now they are in urgent need of mobility, health services, clean water and

                    earnings, coupled with the lost crops, is certain to cause a food crisis. Fodder for livestock and
                    nutrition for children will also present a major challenge.</p>

            <p>According to Relief Web, 4.3 million people have been affected across Bangladesh, of which 1.6 million
                are children. More than 8 children have died as of the 20th, with another one reported on June 22 to be
                a Friendship school student.</p>

            <p>For latrines, the struggle was even more painful. “We had to sneak into our neighbours’ outhouse late at

                The floating latrine is a Friendship innovation being used in flooded and waterlogged areas in the north
